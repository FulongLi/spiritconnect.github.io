    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Spirit Connect – Power Labs was founded to help engineers and companies accelerate innovation in
      power electronics. Our mission is to make converter development faster, safer, and more insightful
      by uniting physics-based models, rich component data, and AI optimization techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work across <strong>DC-DC</strong>, <strong>DC-AC</strong>, and hybrid microgrid systems, with special expertise in
      <strong>wide-bandgap devices (SiC/GaN)</strong>, advanced control, and thermal/EMI reliability.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>AI-assisted design</h3>
        <p>Automating topology exploration, parameter tuning, and control synthesis while respecting
        real-world constraints — thermal limits, EMI, cost, and manufacturability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Data-rich component libraries</h3>
        <p>Comprehensive semiconductor and magnetics databases to enable fast trade-offs and reliable
        efficiency/thermal predictions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Model-to-lab workflow</h3>
        <p>Connecting simulation and optimization to hardware validation with test scripts, HIL/SIL hooks,
        and measurement planning.</p>
